Got a bunch of friends that want to have a Rocket League tournament, and you want to randomize the teams? Yeah, me neither. This is for someone who does.


### How to Use

Use the [webapp][] right in your browser. [Click here][webapp] or click the link in the repo description above.

### How to Modify

### How it Works

The [webapp][] is just static HTML served by GitHub Pages. Find it fully built in the [docs/](https://github.com/ChaoticWeg/tourney-creator/tree/master/docs) directory. The rest of it is just a Node app used for development and building purposes &ndash; it builds the webapp to `docs/` and serves it as a static site, much in the way that gh-pages does.
